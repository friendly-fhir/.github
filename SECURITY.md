## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

At Friendly FHIR, we take security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts
to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

## Safe Harbor

Friendly FHIR supports responsible disclosure. If you discover a security issue,
we ask that you:

- Refrain from accessing or modifying data without explicit permission.
- Avoid interrupting or degrading the performance of our services.
- Do not publicly disclose the issue until we have addressed it.
