# Friendly FHIR

**Friendly FHIR** is an organization that aims to provide better open-source
library and tooling back to the healthcare community. Everything is available
for free, and always will be.

The goal of providing this functionality is to foster a community of developers
who can build on top of the FHIR standard to create new and innovative tooling
and best in-class healthcare systems for future generations.

Lets make the world a better place together, one library at a time! ü§ù
