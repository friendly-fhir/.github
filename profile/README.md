# Friendly FHIR

**Friendly FHIR** is an organization that aims to provide better open-source
library and tooling back to the healthcare community. Everything is available
for free, and always will be.

The goal of providing this functionality is to foster a community of developers
who can build on top of the FHIR standard to create new and innovative tooling
and best in-class healthcare systems for future generations.

Lets make the world a better place together, one library at a time! ü§ù

## Organization Goals

This organization aims to overtime provide the following to the healthcare
community:

* **Clean-room implementations** of FHIR standards in various programming
  languages. This includes FHIRPath, FSH, and CQL -- to be offered in Go and
  Rust.

* **Starting Points** for developers to get up and running quickly with FHIR
  development through means of [GitHub Repository Templates].

* **Educational Resources** to help developers learn about FHIR and how to
  implement it in their projects.

* **Tooling** to allow developers to better validate FHIR resources, generate
  code from FHIR resources, spawn up test servers, and more.

## Starting Points

We offer starting points for developers to get up and running quickly with
FHIR development:

* [`sushi-fhir-ig-template`]: An easy starting point for producing a new FHIR
  IG with automatic CI and CD.

## Active Projects

* [`fhenix`]: A generator that converts `StructureDefinition` resources into
  code for various programming languages.

## How can I contribute?

More on this to come in the coming weeks -- check back soon!
