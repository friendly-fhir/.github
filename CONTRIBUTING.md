# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Friendly FHIR!
We welcome contributions from the community to help make our projects even
better. To ensure a smooth and collaborative process, please follow these
guidelines:

## Prerequisites

Before opening any pull requests, please make sure an Issue has been created and
*preferably* has been assigned to you. Note that this will require a
[Github account](https://github.com/signup/free).

## Contributing

### Did you find a bug?

If you think you've found a bug, please verify that an existing issue has not
already been opened before opening a new issue.

Please clearly describe your issue using the respective template.

Make sure to describe how to **reproduce** the bug. If possible, attach a
complete example which demonstrates the error. Please also state what you
expected to happen instead of the error.

If you found a compilation error, please tell us which compiler (version and
operating system) you used and paste the (relevant part of) the error messages
to the ticket.

### Do you wish to suggest a new feature, or change an existing one?

If you wish to suggest a new feature or change an existing one, please open a
**discussion** so we can talk the specifics of the suggestion before it comes
to a pull-request.

If you propose a change or addition, try to give an example how the improved
code could look like or how to use it.

### Do you have a question about the library or project?

If you have any questions about the code or the project, please feel free to ask
your question in the respective **Q&A Discussion** section

### Are you opening a pull-request?

Please fill in the **pull-request** with sufficient details to clearly describe
the problem being solved, and the solution implemented. Make sure to include a
reference to the relevant issue number(s). If this is a code change, ensure that
any new code attempts to follow existing conventions within the library, and
that all trailing whitespace is trimmed.

## Please Don't üôè

* Please do not open pull requests that address multiple issues. Open multiple
  pull requests, so that issues can be dealt with independently.

* Please avoid opening feature pull-requests without first starting a
  discussion. New features can take time to come to an agreement, and it's
  better to discuss these first to avoid any potential disappointment or
  disagreements that may arise during a review.
