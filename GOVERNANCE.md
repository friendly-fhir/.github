# Governance Model

## Decision Making Process

### Initial Phase (Low Contributor Count)

During the early stages of this project, decision-making primarily revolves
around the project leads due to the limited number of active contributors.
This approach ensures that decisions can be made swiftly and effectively to
meet project goals and milestones.

### Decision Criteria

Decisions regarding the project roadmap, feature implementations, and major
changes will be based on the following criteria:

- **Project Needs**: Decisions will prioritize addressing project requirements,
  including feature requests, bug fixes, and technical improvements.

- **Technical Feasibility**: Assessing whether proposed changes are technically
  feasible and align with the project's architecture and standards.

- **Community Impact**: Consideration of how decisions may impact the project's
  community, including contributors and users.

- **Consensus Building**: Where feasible and appropriate, efforts will be made
  to build consensus among contributors, especially as the contributor base grows.

### Contributor Engagement

As the number of contributors increases, the governance model will evolve to
encourage broader participation in decision-making processes. This will include:

- **Establishing Contribution Guidelines**: Defining clear guidelines for
  contributing to the project, including code reviews, issue triaging, and
  feature proposals.

- **Opening Discussions**: Encouraging open discussions and feedback from
  contributors on major decisions through platforms such as GitHub Issues or
  dedicated communication channels.

- **Voting Mechanisms**: Implementing voting mechanisms or consensus-building
  techniques to involve contributors in significant decisions when necessary.

### Transparency and Communication

To maintain transparency and effective communication:

- **Decision Logs**: Maintaining records of major decisions, rationale, and
  outcomes to provide visibility into the project's evolution.

- **Regular Updates**: Providing regular updates to contributors and the
  community on project developments, decisions, and upcoming milestones.

- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establishing channels for receiving feedback from
  the community on project direction and governance practices.
