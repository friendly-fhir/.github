  error-on-dirty:
    description: |
      If the repository is dirty, should the action error and not push?

      Being in a dirty-state usually means something is either not added in a
      commit, or is not ignored by the .gitignore file. This is a good indicator
      that something is wrong, and should be fixed before pushing.

      Defaults to true.
    required: false
    default: "true"
  push-flags:
    description: |
      Additional flags to pass to the push command.
      No flags on by default. This is where you can pass --force to overwrite
      the remote branch.
